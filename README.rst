=============================
Bricker - A Tetris-like clone
=============================

Bricker is a fun Tetris clone written in Python 3 using the PyGame
library.

Note: Recent MacOS versions (Catalina, etc) have known issues with
current PyGame versions (1.9.6 is most current).  This seems to be
fixed with beta versions (2.0.0.dev6 works).  This shouldn't be needed
on Windows, Linux, etc.
